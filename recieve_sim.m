% Simulation of recieving a sine like QADM project
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% DESCRIPTION:
% This script performs the following steps:
% 1.  Signal Preparation
%     - dac_signal from waveform_sim multiplied by sin(wt) of his own frequency
%     - resample that signal by the factor p, q, which will be output from he
%       function rat() and the different sample frequencies.
%       To resample, the function resample() will  be used.
% 2.  Filter the signal with FIR
%     - adjusted the factor W on the new sample frequency (B, A stay the same
%       as in waveform_sim).
%     - using the function filter() with the coeeficent calculated before
% 3.  Ploting the results
